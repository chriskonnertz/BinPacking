# BinPacking

Examples of algorithms that solve the bin packing problem. Implemented in Kotlin.
A demo is included (`Demo.kt`).

Learn more about the problem and the algorithms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem

## Implemented algorithms

* First Fit (class `FirstFit`)
* First Fit Decreasing (class `FirstFitDecreasing`)

The concrete algorithm classes inherit from the abstract super class `BinPackagingAlgorithm`.
